Info about me and context for projects

Web developer with a passion for creating apps that make you smile. I implement brilliant code for brilliant solutions.

I originally worked on an array of creative projects in 3D fabrication, from custom modular electronic signs, to mechanical display models, boutique custom electronic housings + more and now I've turned my sights to code. Using Javascript, React, and TypeScript (so far) to build apps that entertain.

When I work I bring an optimistic and chipper attitude with a hint of my cheeky nature to ease the tension.

## Duck Finderz
For our final project with Dev Academy Aotearoa, I pitched an idea which was voted on and decided as the direction for the final project. The idea was to create an interactive and entertaining website centered around collecting ducks from webpages. The project was implemented in two ways, the first is a site that lets you sign up for an account, receive a username and view the ducks you have collected. The second is a chrome extension which I was primarily responsible for that can be signed into and that inserts ducks into web pages that can then be clicked on to collect them for the associated username.

## Cat Couture
Before I attended dev academy Aotearoa, I was attending developers institute before its liquidation in 2023. This was the final assessment for the third quarter of that course. The assessment was to fix a websites problems, implement new features to a high standard following design patterns such as the repository pattern, and implement efficient, effective, maintainable test suites and documentation for the longevity and health of the project. 

## Yetan Chatbot
For one of my earliest assessments with developers institute, I created a chatbot for deciding what type of character the user would like to play in the table-top roleplaying game known as Dungeons and Dragons fifth edition. It is a simple website deployed through render. I is well tested and while it is not the grandest project I have been a part of I am proud of it, and it brings me joy.
